## HW2

A convertor which converts a normal context free grammar (CFG) file to a grammar file in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)

## HW3

CKY parsing algorithm. 

## HW4

Probabilistic CKY parsing algorithm. 

## HW5

Build a Feature-based Grammar file which can be read and processed by NLTK. 

## HW6

A system which reads manually created representations and does semantic parsing. 

## HW7

A system which creates and evaluates count-based models of distributional semantic similarity.

## HW8

A system which does Word Sense Disambinguation(WSD) using Resnik's similarity measure

## HW9
